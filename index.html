            <p>To give a little background, I'm 28 years old and recently engaged to my beautiful fiance Cassidi. We
                have just
                recently relocated out here to Arizona from California and our family consists of just one dog whos name
                is
                Roman and he is a husky. My educational background consists of a B.A. in business administration with an
                emphasis in management. Some of the hobbies/passions that I enjoy in the my free time would be golfing,
                playing
                and watching hockey, and playing video games.</p>
            <P>What began my interest in learning how to code started when I first began working for Coca-Cola in
                southern
                California. Working there as account manager I was always more facinated with the behind the scenes kind
                of work
                and the data and information we used out in field. At that point I knew I wanted to make my life long
                career to
                be in the IT industry, specifically in the coding and infrastructure aspect of it.</P>
